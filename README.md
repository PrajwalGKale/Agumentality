# agumentality [ AR_GYM ]

<h3> What is Ar ?</h3><br>
Augmented reality (AR for short) is defined as "the real-time use of information in the form of text, graphics, audio, or other virtual enhancements integrated with real-world objects." This generally means that digital imagery, or data, is rendered onto real-world objects like actual physical things or, at times, integrated into more traditional media like live video streams or heads-up displays, or special augmented reality glasses.

# Modules Developed YET<br><br>
<h2><u>Geometrical Shapes Module ðŸ”´</u></h2><br>
In this module, user has the freedom to choose whichever shape he want to render from given 3 types of shape(i.e. sphere, cube, cylinder). Due to plugin of AR Core library which support on Android we can only render up to 3 shapes only. After choosing the shape user can also select radius and according to his need. Either he can choose color or he can choose from different gradient of colors and also In this particular module user has the flexibility to use various images and pattern of his choice and that images and pattern will then get rendered his chosen desire Shapes on his smartphone at realtime. All the custom things selected by the user will get virtually  rendered onto his smartphone.
