# Agumentality [ AR_GYM ]

<h3> What is Ar ?</h3><br>
Augmented reality (AR for short) is defined as "the real-time use of information in the form of text, graphics, audio, or other virtual enhancements integrated with real-world objects." This generally means that digital imagery, or data, is rendered onto real-world objects like actual physical things or, at times, integrated into more traditional media like live video streams or heads-up displays, or special augmented reality glasses.

# Modules Developed YET<br><br>
<h2><u>Geometrical Shapes Module 🔴</u></h2><br>
In this module, user has the freedom to choose whichever shape he want to render from given 3 types of shape(i.e. sphere, cube, cylinder). Due to plugin of AR Core library which support on Android we can only render up to 3 shapes only. After choosing the shape user can also select radius and according to his need. Either he can choose color or he can choose from different gradient of colors and also In this particular module user has the flexibility to use various images and pattern of his choice and that images and pattern will then get rendered his chosen desire Shapes on his smartphone at realtime. All the custom things selected by the user will get virtually  rendered onto his smartphone.

<h2><u>Furniture Module🪑</u></h2><br>In this module, we are goanna use catalog of different furniture and select the furniture we want to see rendered and that particular furniture will be virtually rendered in users smartphone at realtime. By this particular feature he can virtually spot the location where he needs to place that furniture. We have also included one useful feature and that feature will redirect user to email app as he clicks on the button option given to him. In that email reception section is auto-filled by official company’s e-mail ID and  subject of e-mail also auto-filled and body will consist of the photo of furniture liked by the user, he can then send mail to that company and get that desire furniture delivered at his door steps.<br>

<h2><u>Furniture Module 🦸</u></h2><br>The purpose of this module is to explore how 2D image can be linked and used with augmented reality on mobile devices. Augmented Images is a feature that allows you to build AR apps that can respond to specific 2D images such as rendering or stimulate the 2D images at real-time from our smartphone devices. Users can trigger AR experiences when they point their phone's camera at specific images - for instance, Images can be compiled offline . 
If we need to create character models digitally in the real world. So, we have to combine with other rendering features (e.g. position, rendering, and physics), it is designed for the most widely used AR content and provides an extra solid layer of in-depth user experience. “Recognition and Placing of objects in real size” and the “creating lighting of virtual objects as real as possible”. ARCORE uses the Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) for that, which links incoming camera data with the data of Gyroscope (Position and Rotation) and the data of the Acceleration Sensor (Movements and Orientation) of the smart device can then be accurately calculated and tracking established. Size relations between reality and virtual additions can be strictly compared at the same time.
Augmented Images is a feature that allows you to build AR apps that can respond to specific 2D images such as product packaging or movie posters. Users can trigger AR experiences when they point their phone's camera at specific images - for instance, they could point their phone's camera at a movie poster and have a character pop out and enact a scene.<br>
